\section{Configuration Management}

\subsection{Git}

As a version control system git was used. This time it was not used like an SVN
replacement but instead to get some redundancy by storing the source code on
multiple server. Both project developer had their ``own`` git server on which
the developer committed. It was merged between these server and the pushed to
the main repository for automatic testing.

\subsection{Maven and Tycho}

Tycho is a plug-in for Maven to build the plug-in and the execute the tests.
Maven3 is required for this to work. Even if Maven3 is in beta state it is
quite stable.\newline
To execute the tests on a headless server with Hudson build server first a fake
X Server is needed. Xvfb was used in our case for the job.
Another thing is you must explicitly tell Maven which test class to execute and
in which folder the test class is located. If this is not done properly the
tests will fail.

\subsection{Hudson}

To get the tests executed on the fake X sever, the \texttt{DISPLAY} environment
variable must be set. If not, tests will fail with a cryptic
SWTError.\newline
There is a plug-in for Hudson to set the environment variable to
the right value. In most cases this is \textbf{:0}.
