\section{Testing and Performance}

This section introduces special tricks that were used to simplify testing and
control performance.

\subsection{Fuzzy whitespace recognition}

As described in past theses at HSR, the refactoring testing environment
needed an exact definition of the generated code. This was annoying because
same-looking code samples could result in a red bar if white spaces were not the
same. To make writing new tests easier, the comparison method was overridden to
support fuzzy whitespace recognition.

Leading tabs or whitespaces are recognized and it is assumed that the same
indention is used for the whole file. In addition, trailing newlines that are
added by the ASTRewriter are ignored.

The changes made to the CDT test environment help writing new tests without
having to care whether the ASTRewriter uses spaces or tabs for indention.
Resulting code that looks the same now gives a green bar.

\subsection{Performance tests}

Performance was tested using the org.eclipse.test.performance plugin. Four
different scenarios have been chosen for comparison:

\begin{enumerate}
\item testWithIncludeStatements()
\item testWithoutIncludeStatements()
\item testInClassToInHeader()
\item testInHeaderToInClass()
\end{enumerate}

In addition, an all-together test has been included for quick performance
comparison and a reference test that did nothing was run to measure the overhead
of the performance test framework. Since in reality the refactorings are slower
than the (repeated) measurements, resulting values should be considered relative
to each other. The same developer laptop was used for before and after tests.

 Scenario   & first draft & final result & improvement in \% \\

 Scenario 1	&  364ms & --ms & --\% \\
 Scenario 2	&  337ms & --ms & --\% \\
 Scenario 3	&  335ms & --ms & --\% \\
 Scenario 4	&  323ms & --ms & --\% \\
 All tests	& 5530ms & --ms & --\% \\
 Reference test	&    0ms & --ms & --\% \\
