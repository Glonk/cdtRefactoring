\begin{abstract}
During this semester thesis, a code automation tool has been developed for the 
Eclipse C++ Development Toolkit (CDT) using the Eclipse refactoring mechanism. 
The resulting plugin enables a C++ developer to move function definitions easily 
between header and source files.

The new plugin differs from existing plugins in the way that it minimizes human 
interaction by providing a single keystroke interface. The refactoring gets by 
with no user wizard at all and is tolerant to imprecise code selection. 

This document discusses the uses of the plugin as well as the issues that had 
to be handled with during the project. Students developing a new refactoring may 
have a look at the problems section to be able to start with their own project 
quickly. Project setup hints are listed in the appendix.
\end{abstract}

\chapter*{Management Summary}
This semester thesis tries to make programming C++ more fun and more efficient, 
providing a tool that automates code changes with a single keystroke. Using the 
developed plugin, a programmer can save touching multiple code files with just 
one action.

As in writing books, writing software involves text editors. Developers of 
computer software are using highly specialized text editors. These provide a 
wide range of tools that simplify daily tasks of a programmer. One such task is 
moving a function from one place to another. During this semester thesis, an 
existing C++ code editor has been extended to support moving functions between 
various places quick and user-friendly.
