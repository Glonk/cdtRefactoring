\chapter{Time management}
\thispagestyle{fancy}
This chapter should help other students guessing the amount of work that is 
involved in writing a refactoring semester thesis.

\section{Time budget}
The extent of work expected for a semester thesis at HSR is 8 ECTS which 
corresponds to an effort of 240 hours per person. Tickets were generated after 
the meetings on Thursday and an amount of time was guessed for them. 

\section{What the charts are saying}
These charts and tables illustrate the workload by week and by topic:
% TODO: Insert charts and tables from redmine

\section{What the team is saying}
Charts are generated out of numbers which have been typed in by humans. There 
has been a time between week eight and ten where time tracking was abandoned and 
added three weeks later. Also, there were a lot of discussions that could not 
have been assigned to a specific issue. Not every minute was tracked, so be 
aware that the data given may vary about ten percent.
