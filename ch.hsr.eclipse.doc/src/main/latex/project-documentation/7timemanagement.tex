\chapter{Time Management}
\thispagestyle{fancy}
This chapter should help other students guessing the amount of work that is 
involved in writing a refactoring semester thesis.

\section{Time Budget}
The extent of work expected for a semester thesis at HSR is 8 ECTS which 
corresponds to an effort of 240 hours per person. Issues were created after 
the meetings on Thursday and an amount of time was guessed for them.

As mentioned in the section \ref{notgood} we sometimes forgot to log the time
right away. Later we guessed the time invested in the issues we worked on.

\section{What the Charts Tell us}
This tables illustrate the workload by week and team member.

project to 11th of November}

\end{figure}

Summing up all, results in about 450 hours worked for the project.

\section{What the Team is Saying}
Charts are generated out of numbers which have been typed in by humans. There 
has been a time between week eight and ten where time tracking was abandoned and 
added three weeks later. (See also section \ref{notgood}). Also, there were a
lot of discussions that could not have been assigned to a specific issue. Not
every minute was tracked, so be aware that the actual spent time was about ten
percent above the reported time.
