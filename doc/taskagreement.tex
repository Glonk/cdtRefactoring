\section*{Task agreement for CDT refactoring semester thesis}

During this semester thesis it is planned to introduce and improve one or more refactorings to the Eclipse CDT project. The priorities are as follows

\begin{enumerate}
\item Toggle (Member-) Function Implementation
\item Override virtual Member Function
\item Re-implement Implement Function
\end{enumerate}

Our goal is to start with the first refactoring to gain insight on how to solve the other two refactorings since they share some similarities. However it is not our goal to implement as many refactorings as possible. We don't want our work to be thrown away at the end of the semester. To become part of the main CDT repository our work needs to fulfill three requirements: Quality, speed and integration. \newline

Quality is achieved through automatic testing. Refactorings are thankful to test since they have a clear before and after state. As for speed, a maximum of one second of response time for small and frequent tasks is acceptable\footnote{Shneiderman, B., \emph{Response time and display rate in human performance with computers}, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 1984}. For example \texttt{Extract function} consumes about four seconds to extract the body of a hello world code. Our goal is to process local changes in less than a second. The last matter is integration. We think we did good work if a first semester student sitting in front of a fresh CDT installation is able to install our refactoring in less than five minutes given the update site address. In addition the deployment process should take at most three commands to integrate a code change. Let's now turn to functional requirements. \newline

There are theoretically six different ways of toggling function implementation although not every variation is useful. Three of them are needed to toggle circularly from \texttt{in-class} to \texttt{in-header} to \texttt{separate-file} and back again to \texttt{in-class}. We concentrate on this order during this project until we realize that another order would be more comfortable. Depending on the success of the implementation of those three variations of the first refactoring we continue with "Override virtual member function" and "Re-implement implement function". \newline

The semester thesis starts on September 20th and ends on December xx 2010.
